# I. Enhanced User Interaction for World Details

## **I. Enhanced User Interaction for World Details**

* **A. Location Selection:**

    * **1. Hierarchical Location Prompts:**
        * **Concept:** Instead of a single list of all locations, present a hierarchical structure mirroring `world_details.json`.
        * **Implementation:**
            ```python
            from rich.prompt import Prompt, Confirm

            def prompt_for_location(world_details):
                """Prompts the user to select a location, handling hierarchical structure."""
                location_options = list(world_details["locations"].keys())
                location = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold blue]Choose a main location (or None)",
                    choices=location_options + ["None"],
                    default="None",
                )

                if location == "None":
                    return None

                # If the chosen location has 'places', prompt for a sub-location
                while "places" in world_details["locations"][location]:
                    place_options = list(
                        world_details["locations"][location]["places"].keys()
                    )
                    place = Prompt.ask(
                        f"[bold blue]Choose a specific place within {
                            location} (or Back)",
                        choices=place_options + ["Back"],
                        default="Back",
                    )
                    if place == "Back":
                        break  # Go back to the main location prompt

                    location = f"{location} - {place}"  # Update location to include place

                return location

            # Example usage in generate_chapter_tui():
            location = prompt_for_location(world_details)
            if location:
                situation = f"{situation} (in {location})"
            ```
        * **Benefits:** More organized, reflects the structure of the data, allows for more specific location setting.

    * **2. Location Descriptions in Prompts:**
        * **Concept:** Show the location's description alongside its name to help users make informed choices.
        * **Implementation:**
            * Modify `prompt_for_location()` to display descriptions using `rich` formatting (e.g., in a `Panel` next to the option).
            * This might require adjusting the layout using `Layout` to accommodate the descriptions.
            * Consider a "More Info" option that expands to show the full description if it's too long.

* **B. Theme and Motif Selection:**

    * **1. Checkbox-Style Selection:**
        * **Concept:** Use a checkbox-like interface (or multi-select prompt) to allow users to choose multiple themes and motifs.
        * **Implementation:**
            ```python
            from rich.prompt import Prompt

            def prompt_for_themes_and_motifs(world_details):
                """Prompts the user to select themes and motifs."""
                selected_themes = []
                selected_motifs = []

                theme_options = list(world_details["themes"].keys())
                selected_themes = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold blue]Select themes to emphasize (comma-separated, or None)",
                    choices=theme_options + ["None"],
                    default="None",
                )

                if selected_themes != "None":
                    selected_themes = [theme.strip() for theme in selected_themes.split(',')]

                motif_options = list(world_details["motifs"].keys())
                selected_motifs = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold blue]Select motifs to use (comma-separated, or None)",
                    choices=motif_options + ["None"],
                    default="None",
                )

                if selected_motifs != "None":
                    selected_motifs = [motif.strip() for motif in selected_motifs.split(',')]

                return selected_themes, selected_motifs

            # Example usage:
            themes, motifs = prompt_for_themes_and_motifs(world_details)
            ```
        * **Benefits:** Clearer selection of multiple items, more intuitive than typing comma-separated values.

    * **2. Theme and Motif Explanations:**
        * **Concept:** Provide brief explanations of themes and motifs to guide users.
        * **Implementation:**
            * Similar to location descriptions, display explanations alongside theme/motif options.
            * Use `rich.table.Table` or `rich.panel.Panel` to format the choices and explanations nicely.

* **C. Lore Element Management:**

    * **1. "Quick Add" Lore:**
        * **Concept:** Implement the "quick add" as described before, allowing single-prompt lore creation.
        * **Implementation:**
            ```python
            from rich.prompt import Prompt

            def quick_add_lore(world_details):
                """Allows quick addition of a new lore element."""
                new_lore = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold blue]Add a new lore element (e.g., 'Term: Description')"
                )
                if new_lore:
                    try:
                        term, description = new_lore.split(":", 1)
                        term = term.strip()
                        description = description.strip()
                        if "lore" not in world_details:
                            world_details["lore"] = {}
                        world_details["lore"][term] = {"description": description}
                        console.print(
                            f"[green]Lore element '{term}' added successfully![/green]"
                        )
                    except ValueError:
                        console.print(
                            "[red]Invalid format. Use 'Term: Description'[/red]"
                        )

            # Example usage in interactive_loop() or a dedicated menu:
            quick_add_lore(world_details)
            ```

    * **2. Dedicated Lore Menu (for more complex edits):**
        * **Concept:** Create a separate TUI menu for browsing, adding, modifying, and deleting lore elements.
        * **Implementation:**
            * Add a new function `lore_management_menu()`.
            * Use a loop to present options:
                * "View existing lore" (display in a formatted way)
                * "Add new lore element" (prompt for term and description)
                * "Edit existing lore element" (select element, then prompt for changes)
                * "Delete lore element" (select element, then confirm deletion)
            * Call this function from `interactive_loop()` or as an option in the main menu.
            * **Important:** Update the `world_details` dictionary after each modification.

    * **3. Saving Lore Changes:**
        * **Concept:** Make lore changes persistent by saving them back to `world_details.json`.
        * **Implementation:**
            * Create a function `save_world_details(world_details, filepath="data/world_details.json")` that writes the `world_details` dictionary to the JSON file.
            * Call `save_world_details()` after any modification to `world_details` (in `quick_add_lore()`, `lore_management_menu()`, etc.).

**II. Integrating World Details into `create_prompt()`**

* **A. Location Incorporation:**

    * You're already doing this well in your provided code snippet. Ensure the location (and potentially sub-location) are clearly stated in the prompt.

* **B. Theme and Motif Emphasis:**

    * Modify `create_prompt()` to include sections like:
        ```python
        # ... (rest of create_prompt)

        if selected_themes:
            prompt.append("\nThis chapter should emphasize the following themes:")
            for theme in selected_themes:
                prompt.append(f"- {theme}: {world_details['themes'][theme]['subthemes']}")

        if selected_motifs:
            prompt.append("\nIncorporate the following motifs:")
            for motif in selected_motifs:
                prompt.append(f"- {motif}: {world_details['motifs'][motif]}")

        # ... (rest of create_prompt)
        ```

* **C. Lore Integration:**

    * **1. Contextual Lore:**
        * **Concept:** Only include lore elements that are relevant to the current situation, location, characters, or themes.
        * **Implementation:**
            * In `create_prompt()`, before adding lore, check if the lore element's term or description contains keywords related to the current context.
            * You might need a more sophisticated method than simple keyword matching for complex scenarios (e.g., using your embedding model to find semantically related lore).

    * **2. Explicit Lore References:**
        * **Concept:** If the user has added a new lore element, or if you want to ensure a specific element is used, add an instruction like:
            ```python
            prompt.append(
                f"\nMake sure to incorporate the lore element: '{
                    new_lore_term}' ({world_details['lore'][new_lore_term]['description']})"
            )
            ```

**III. Example: Putting It Together**

```python
# ... (imports, utility functions)

def generate_chapter_tui():
    # ... (initial setup)

    # Load world details
    config = load_config()
    world_details = load_world_details(config['paths']['world_details'])

    # --- Dynamic World Detail Integration ---
    location = prompt_for_location(world_details)
    themes, motifs = prompt_for_themes_and_motifs(world_details)
    quick_add_lore(world_details)

    # ... (rest of the prompts for query, style, character, etc.)

    # --- Generate Story ---
    # ... (call to generate_story, passing in world_details, themes, motifs, location)

def create_prompt( # ... other parameters
                  selected_themes: List[str] = None,
                  selected_motifs: List[str] = None,
                  location: str = None,
                  # ... other parameters
                 ):
    # ... your existing prompt creation logic ...

    # --- Incorporate dynamic selections ---

    if location:
        # You are already handling location well

    if selected_themes:
        # Add theme emphasis to the prompt

    if selected_motifs:
        # Add motif usage instructions to the prompt

    if world_details.get("lore"):
        # Add relevant lore elements to the prompt

    # ... rest of your prompt creation logic ...
```

**IV. Further Refinements**

* **World Detail Embeddings:** Generate embeddings for your world details (locations, themes, motifs, lore). This could enable more intelligent selection of relevant details based on the current context.
* **User Profiles:** Consider allowing users to create profiles that store their preferred world details, writing styles, etc.
* **Advanced Editing:** For complex edits (like modifying theme subthemes), consider integrating a simple text editor or a form-based interface within the TUI.
